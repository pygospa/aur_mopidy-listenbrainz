# AUR mopidy-listenbrainz

This is an AUR package for Arch Linux based distributions,
packaging the official release of
[mopidy-listenbrainz](https://github.com/suaviloquence/mopidy-listenbrainz)
plugin for system-wide installations.
This is necessary if you don't want to use
[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
as Arch Linux does not permit system-wide instalaltions via
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/).

This package is an
[official AUR repo](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/?h=mopidy-listenbrainz).
However those repos are accessible by one maintainer only.
If you want to participate in maintaining the package,
please use the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/pygospa/aur_mopidy-listenbrainz)
to send me a pull request with your changes.
